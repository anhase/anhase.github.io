Using GitHub Pages to publish my prepared remarks for my presentation from LibrePlanet 2017:

SLIDE 1

Good afternoon, 

Thank you for joining me today at LibrePlanet. Thank you to the Free Software Foundation and MIT's Student Information Processing Board for this opportunity. My name is Andrew Seeder.  This strategic action session is called "Technology for Direct Actions." I hope you're in the right room!

For those listening here and online, my presentation is meant for educational purposes only. It does not reflect the opinions of my employer. TW: I will mention violence against activists in terms of numbers of injuries and deaths. Let me take a moment to read LibrePlanet's safe space policy:

"Safe Space Policy
If you need to file a report, find a staff member or ask a volunteer to help you find one.

The FSF is dedicated to providing a harassment-free LibrePlanet experience for everyone.

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Offensive or graphic sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. 

Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers. 

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the FSF staff immediately. FSF staff are available in every conference session and at the information desk throughout the conference. 
Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. 
We value your attendance and hope you enjoy the conference."

Speaking of whom, would any FSF staff or conference volunteers raise their hand. Please join me in thanking them. Thank you for organizing this conference.

My goal today is to describe some of the challenges and opportunities technology brings to direct actions. What kinds of direct actions? Let's start with protests.
